# üíß Smart Water Level Indicator with Auto Cutoff

## üìò Project Description

This project is designed to **prevent water tank overflow** by automatically switching **OFF the motor** when the tank is full. It is a simple, low-cost, and effective solution to **save water and electricity**, especially useful in households where manual monitoring of motor/tank levels is inconvenient.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Water tank overflows due to the motor being left ON manually. This leads to:
- Unnecessary **water wastage**
- **Increased electricity bills**
- **Manual dependency** to monitor the tank status

---

## ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

The solution is a **mechanical switch system** based on a **floating plastic ball**:

- A **plastic ball** floats on the surface of the water inside the tank.
- When the tank fills up, the ball **rises to the top**.
- The ball is connected to a **mechanical switch** at the tank lid.
- When triggered, this switch:
  - Activates a circuit that **cuts off the motor** using a relay.
  - Turns ON a **red LED** and **buzzer** as alerts.
  
The circuit involves basic electronic components and uses **BC547 transistor**, **7805 voltage regulator**, **relay**, and supporting components.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle

1. **Power Supply**: 12V input regulated to 5V using 7805 and filtered using capacitors.
2. **Switch Trigger**: Mechanical switch closes when floating ball rises with water level.
3. **Transistor Control**: BC547 turns off the relay when triggered.
4. **Motor Control**: Relay disconnects motor supply.
5. **Alert**: Red LED lights up and buzzer sounds.

## üí° Benefits

- üíß Prevents water overflow
- ‚ö° Saves electricity by auto-cutoff
- üë®‚Äçüîß No microcontroller required
- üîã Simple, cost-effective mechanical-electronic hybrid solution

## üìÇ How to Use

1. Mount the **plastic ball** in the water tank cap using a hinge so it can lift freely.
2. Connect the **mechanical switch** to be triggered by the ball‚Äôs upward movement.
3. Assemble the **relay and circuit components** as per the schematic.
4. Connect the relay output to the **motor supply line**.
5. When the tank is full, the system automatically cuts power to the motor and activates **alerts**.

## üß† Future Improvements

- Add a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) for more control and monitoring.
- Add an LCD or mobile alert system via IoT.
- Add dry-run protection and water source detection.
